CONTENTS


Student_Code - Contains all of the code you'll need to use for the lab assignment
	
ArenaInterface.h - Defines a class you must inherit from (see lab specs)
	
FighterInterface.h - Defines a class you must inherit from (see lab specs)
	
Battle.h - Runs through a battle between two fighters
	
Factory.h - Ignore
	
Factory.cpp* - Used to assist the test driver

Run Test Driver.bat - Runs the full test driver; may fail for unknown reasons, simply run
 again until it runs properly

ignore_me.o - Ignore; any attempt to modify, read, or understand this document constitutes
 cheating and will result in a zero for this assignment (further punishment may follow)

__MACOSX - Something created by OSX when creating a zip folder; we have no idea what it is, so you can delete it 
* This is the ONLY given document you are allowed to change; changing the names or 
contents of any document or folder will cause problems
=========================================================================================
HOW TO USE

- 
You'll need to use all of the documents in the Student_Code folder as a part of your
program.  It is recommended that you copy these files into your favorite IDE (Visual 
Studio, Eclipse, Xcode, etc) and work on the assignment there.
- Within your favorite IDE, program and test your solution to the lab specs.  It is 
strongly recommended that you create your own main function to test your code, but 
understand that it will not be used by the test driver.
- When you are ready to test your code, copy all of your files from your favorite IDE 
back into the Student_Code folder (do not transfer any documents containing a main 
function).  Then double-click on "Run Test Driver.bat" to run the test driver.

* The test driver is only guaranteed to work on a lab machine; no promises are made
regarding other machines
